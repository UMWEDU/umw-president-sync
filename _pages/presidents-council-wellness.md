<h2>Committee Charge</h2>
The World Health Organization defines wellness as "a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."

In 2017, this committee was established to focus on cohesive wellness initiatives at the University of Mary Washington.  The committee will develop strategies for implementation and assessment of impactful wellness efforts on campus.

The Council will do the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Work to create a culture in which all members of the community recognize health - of body and mind - as integral to our learning environment.</li>
 	<li>Conduct needs assessment for both student and employee wellness to include an evaluation of current programs and services.</li>
 	<li>Meet a minimum of once per month.</li>
 	<li>Report a minimum of once per semester to the President's Cabinet outlining recommendations and the committee's progress.</li>
</ul>
