The following guidelines offer parameters for the use of Brompton, the home of the President of the
University of Mary Washington and their family. Brompton functions first and foremost as a
residence. On occasion it is used by others as the University’s way of extending its presence and
good will to the surrounding community and to friends of the University who support its mission and
goals.

Before inquiring about the use of Brompton, campus event planners should make every effort to
reserve other University venues first. A wide variety of venues exists across both University
campuses suitable for meetings, retreats, conferences and other functions. Under no circumstance
should Brompton be considered an extension of the two campuses for regular meeting space.
<h2>Availability</h2>
Brompton is available Monday through Friday. Weekday events must begin no earlier than 10:00
a.m. and end by 9 p.m. If the President is scheduled to attend an event, the time parameters may be
changed with approval.

Brompton may only be used on Saturdays and Sundays for functions that are hosted by the
President, those they plan to attend, or those that are reserved by groups in which the President is
directly involved.

Members of the University of Mary Washington community may request the use of Brompton a
minimum of 45 days and up to one year in advance of the event.
<h2>Booking Protocol</h2>
The requester should:
<ul>
 	<li>Read these guidelines.</li>
 	<li>Complete the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/president/contact-us/brompton/">Brompton Event Space Request Form</a>.</li>
</ul>
Once the completed form is received, the Special Assistant to the President for Events will evaluate
the event for compliance with appropriate use guidelines and check the availability of Brompton.
The Special Assistant to the President for Events will then forward the event request to the
President’s Office for approval.

Upon approval from the President’s Office, the Special Assistant to the President for Events will
contact the requester with a status update. Should the President be unavailable to approve the
request, the Special Assistant to the President for Events and the Chief of Staff will approve the
request. Whenever possible, the requester will be contacted within three days of receipt of the
request.

All events held at Brompton require catering (see Standards). Upon approval of the event request the
UMW Director of Catering will contact the requester for the required catering order.
<h2>Indoor Events</h2>
Due to room size constraints and the desire to preserve Brompton’s fragile and valuable antique
furnishings the following guest accommodation plans will prevail:
<ul>
 	<li>The ground floor may accommodate 125 guests at a standing reception.</li>
 	<li>Ten guests may be seated in the Dining Room.</li>
 	<li>Twenty-four guests may be seated at tables in the Sun Room.</li>
 	<li>Eight guests may be seated in the Red Parlor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Audio-Visual</h2>
Brompton has no black-out shades, nor is built-in technology or audio-visual of any kind available.
<h2>Equipment Rentals</h2>
UMW Dining Services is responsible for providing needed indoor additional china, glass, silver,
table linens, serving pieces, tables and chairs. The costs for rental equipment will be borne by the
requester. UMW Dining Services will provide invoicing for equipment, table linens, and florals on
the final event catering contract.
<h2>Brompton Guest Houses</h2>
The Brompton Guest Houses are reserved for the personal use of the President and their family.
<h2>Outdoor Events</h2>
The lawn and patio may be used for events.
<ul>
 	<li>The lawn will accommodate 400 guests.</li>
 	<li>The patio will accommodate up to 40 seated or 65 standing guests.</li>
</ul>
The Special Assistant to the President for Events arranges for the rental of tents, staging, dance
floors and other outdoor equipment and obtains the proper permits. All delivery and set-up of tents,
tables, chairs, dance floors and other equipment must be scheduled prior to the event by the Special
Assistant to the President for Events. Vendor invoices for outdoor equipment rentals are sent directly
to the requester’s office for payment. Adherence to the City of Fredericksburg noise ordinance is mandatory. (As of March 2005 the City ordinance prohibited outside noise after 10:00 p.m.) Banners
may not be displayed. Outdoor lanterns must be requested on the Brompton Event Request Form and
will be placed only by the University groundskeepers.

The Rose Garden is reserved at all times for the President for University functions and may not be
used for private events such as weddings.
<h2>Catering</h2>
The Special Assistant to the President for Events will make initial contact with Sodexo for the
requester and act as liaison between the catering department and the requester until completion of
the event. UMW Dining Services shall be the exclusive provider of food and beverage for all events
at Brompton.
<h2>Standards</h2>
In keeping with the status of Brompton as one of America’s most historic homes, and its prestigious
place in the University of Mary Washington as the President’s home, certain standards must be
observed.
<ul>
 	<li>For all events that involve dining, rental table linens and floral arrangements must be
provided at the requester’s expense. Additional costs for other necessary amenities will also
be borne by the requester. The Special Assistant to the President for Events will provide
guidance.</li>
 	<li>All Brompton events are by printed invitation only. A final proof of the invitation must be
sent to the Special Assistant to the President for Events prior to printing.</li>
 	<li>You must provide a guest list with notable guest(s), the guest(s) title(s) and guest(s)
connection to the University for the purpose of briefing the President.</li>
 	<li>Coat check is required for all events that take place during cold or inclement weather.</li>
 	<li>Someone must be appointed at the door to greet all guests, direct them to coat check and
catering staff and introduce them to the President, if they are in attendance.</li>
 	<li>Catering is required for all events. The Special Assistant to the President for Events will
decide if rental table linens and florals are required.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Parking</h2>
Guest parking is available on Hanover Street and in the surrounding neighborhood. No reserved
parking is available on the Brompton property.
<h2>Closings and Cancellations</h2>
In the event the University of Mary Washington must close due to inclement weather no uses will be
permitted at Brompton.
