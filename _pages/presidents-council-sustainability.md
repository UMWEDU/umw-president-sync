<h2>Committee Charge</h2>
The President’s Council on Sustainability has a critical role in shaping administrative goals and objectives relating to campus sustainability. The PCS is charged with the creation of a five-year plan and making recommendations on sustainability issues and policy, developing strategies for implementation of sustainability initiatives, and providing a cohesive public face for UMW sustainability efforts. The council will report regularly to the President’s Cabinet outlining recommendations and the university’s progress.

The council will advise and assist in the development of goals in these four action areas: Administration and Finance, Education and Research, Operation, and Innovation and Awareness. The PCS will meet monthly throughout the academic year. Members need to make a significant commitment to sustainability work as each person will participate in additional action groups that undertake projects outside the monthly meetings.
