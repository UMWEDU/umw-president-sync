<h2>Committee Charge</h2>
The Staff Advisory Council is an elected body of classified, wage, and administrative staff whose purpose is to promote collaboration and ensure open communication channels throughout all levels of the University. The council provides an avenue for employee input and feedback and a means of participating in the design, development, and implementation of University programs, projects, and services. It also strengthens employee awareness of critical issues and provides a valuable perspective for the University community and administration on matters of significant concern to wage, classified, and administrative staff.
<h2>Committee Members</h2>
More information on the Staff Advisory Council and its members is available on the <a href="http://sac.umwblogs.org/">S.A.C. website</a>.
