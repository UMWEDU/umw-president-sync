<h2>Committee Charge</h2>
The Town and Gown Committee was established in 2007 to promote positive relations between the University and the residents of the City’s neighborhoods surrounding the Fredericksburg Campus.  It is comprised of University administrators and student leaders, representatives of neighborhood associations, City and University police chiefs, City government administrative officials, and two members of Fredericksburg City Council.  The committee meets two times each year, alternating the meeting sites between University and City facilities.  The Town and Gown Committee discusses a wide variety of relevant issues and works to find solutions to problems that may arise.  The committee plays an important role in information sharing and building cooperative working relationships between UMW and the Fredericksburg community.
